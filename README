Hi, I'm Vince!

I'm just a random retro video game collector living here on the interwebz.

One thing I'm doing with games I collect is dump the SAVE RAM from the carts and memory cards.

This repository is a collection of those dumps.

Why?

Because these are someone's stories. Buying old and used video games, these were hours of play
logged by a child somewhere in the world. I want to preserve at least a piece of those memories
for all to see.

!! ENJOY !!
